CSS-Framworks (Bootstrap)


________________
<<< DEBRIEF >>>

****Issues encountered****

carousel -- images were resized manually with Adobe PS as they were silghtly different aspect ratios. More understanding of CSS & Bootstrap should rectify this

3x middle cards (in a row with gray circles) -- looks fine on mobile, but I'd like them to grow or be more spaced on larger screens, more Bootstrap properties need to be understood

the lower cards (stacked vertically, layout horizontal) -- I was not able to remove the borders or the margin; more research needed

footer "Back to top" button -- this was intended to be right aligned, however it dropped a line with the <div> method & class="btt" methods I originally used (uneven websites look awful to me in a proffesional environment)

more text styling would be extremely useful, but haven't found the correct way as the Bootstrap documentation only seemed to describe SASS methods

side border removal

Back to top button with smooth scrolling implementation
  
investigate Bootstrap properties & customization

Bootstrap is a very useful & capable framework, although as a beginner, the default class attributes are quite confusing

Working from my Win10 machine is far more efficient than the McBook, even with the VS Code terminal for GitHub after getting it configed & now I'm not scared of interacting with GH in this way!
